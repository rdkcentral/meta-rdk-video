Subject: [PATCH] comcast - RDKTV-28214 - Quick _exit

For both WPEWebProcess and WPENetworkProcess:
1) Call std::quick_exit/_exit() just before main() function return to avoid crashes
   in exit handlers and static objects destructions.
   _exit() func terminates a process immediately without any clean up.
2) Override default "exit()" func from libc with local one that will do
   _exit() (exit() is called explicitly in some cases in WebKit code).

We had number of crashes during browser shutdown. They were
happening after returning from main() function inside WPEWebProcess:
1) RDK-43089 Crash on destroying EGLContext after deleting native window
   inside wpe-backend-rdk
2) RDKTV-26066 wpe EGLBackend was destroyed before EGLTarget
   (static window context in non composited webgl).
3) CVTE-281 - Platform display was destroyed before noncomposited webgl
   global window context. This happens when WebPage was not closed
   before exiting from app (e.g. by calling exit(0) explicitly).
4) LLAMA-12832: Crash on release WPEFramework singletons
   (OCDM and TextToSpeech serivces)
5) RDKTV-28214 Use after free on shutdown

Most of the issues should have been fixed already, beside 3)
so we still need to drop the web process before main() func return;

The same happens for WPENetworkProcess:
1) LLAMA-15430: Crash in glib-networking/openssl caused by async
   handshake thread still running after OPENSSL cleaned up its resources
